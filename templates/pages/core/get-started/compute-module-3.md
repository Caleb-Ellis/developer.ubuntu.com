# Compute Module 3

## Ubuntu Core

We will walk you through the steps of flashing Ubuntu Core on a Compute Module 3. At the end of this process, you will have a board ready for production or testing snaps.

### Hardware and software requirements

  * A Compute Module 3
  * A Compute Module IO board
  * Two micro USB to USB cables (one for power, one to setup the CM from the host)
  * An HDMI cable and a display
  * A USB keyboard
  * A USB to RJ45 adaptor or a WiFi dongle
  * A USB hub to attach the keyboard and the RJ45 adaptor/WiFi dongle (note that the keyboard and display can be replaced with a serial cable connected directly to pins of the IO board)
  * An Ubuntu Core image

#### Ubuntu Core image

Once downloaded, you can verify the integrity of the file by following [this tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu), using the [SHA256SUM](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/stable/current/SHA256SUMS) and [SHA256SUM.gpg](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/stable/current/SHA256SUMS.gpg) files.

### Installation instructions

#### 1. On the host system: Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 or above

 1. In a terminal, download the USBboot tool you will use to setup the board, and install its build dependencies:

        git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot.git
        sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev

 * Then `cd` into the usbboot directory, build with `make` and start the resulting binary as root:

        cd usbboot
        make
        sudo ./rpiboot

 * Once started, it will wait for the Compute Module to be attached to the machine.

#### 2. On the Compute Module IO board

 1. Position the Compute Module on the IO board
 * Attach the USB hub, RJ45 adaptor, keyboard and monitor (HDMI) to the board
 * Ensure the `J4` switch (`USB SLAVE BOOT ENABLE`) on the IO board is in the `EN` position             
     ![J4](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/55329e6f-CM3_J4.JPG?w=300)
 * With the first micro USB to USB cable, plug the host machine into the IO Board USB slave port (`J15`)   
     ![J15](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/2073d0aa-CM3_J15.JPG?w=300)
 * With the second micro USB to USB cable, power on the IO board.

#### 3. Back to the host system

 1. The USBboot tool should have recognized the attached Compute Module and mounted the EMMC partition as a new device
 * Identify the device by opening the "Disks" application:
    * Locate the EMMC partition of the Compute Module in the left pane
    * Note down its "Device" address on the right pane.
    * If the partition is mounted, unmount it by clicking the square icon below the partition diagram or the eject icon in a file manager
 * Download the [Ubuntu Core image](#ubuntu-core-image). When this is done you should have an `ubuntu-core-16-cm3.img.xz` file in your `~/Downloads` directory
 * Flash Ubuntu Core on the EMMC partition with:

        xzcat ~/Downloads/<image file .xz> | sudo dd of=<device address> bs=32M; sync

     This process will take some time. After completion, you can reboot your Compute Module IO board and follow the first boot process with the display, keyboard and RJ45/WiFI dongle attached to it.
